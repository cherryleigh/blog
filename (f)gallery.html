<h4>Blue Spring Ride</h4>
<p>
Blue Spring Ride (Ao Haru Ride) is a Japanese coming-of-age romance story that follows the emotional journey of Futaba Yoshioka, a high school student trying to reshape her life after painful social experiences in middle school. When she was younger, other girls became jealous of the attention she received from boys, causing her to feel rejected and isolated. Determined not to repeat that experience, Futaba deliberately changes her behavior in high school, acting less traditionally feminine so she can fit in and avoid being excluded. Her carefully constructed identity begins to unravel when she reunites with Kou Tanaka—her first love—who had suddenly moved away years earlier without explanation.

The Kou she meets again is no longer the gentle boy she remembers. Now going by the name Kou Mabuchi, he appears distant, cynical, and emotionally guarded after experiencing serious family hardships, including his mother’s illness and death. His personality shift leaves Futaba confused and determined to understand what happened during the years they were apart. As they slowly reconnect, the story explores Futaba’s efforts to rediscover her authentic self while building real friendships and facing complicated feelings that never fully disappeared. Their relationship becomes a central thread, showing how people can change while still carrying pieces of their past.

<h4>My Hero Academia</h4>

The story is set in a world where most people are born with special superpowers called “Quirks.” Because these abilities are so common, heroism has become an official profession, with licensed heroes trained, regulated, and held responsible for how they use their powers.
